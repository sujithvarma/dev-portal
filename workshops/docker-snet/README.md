# SingularityNet workshop examples

Docker image and number of simple application examples which demonstrate how to
work with SingularityNet platform.

For the sake of clarity and simplicity it is a prepared environment which
simulates behaviour of the Ethereum testnet like Kovan. But all things you are
doing happens in your own instance of Ganache and doesnâ€™t affect any public
networks.

Prerequisites:
* [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Hardware requirements:
* 1 Gb free RAM to run docker image
* 4 Gb free disk space to keep docker image

Clone repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/singnet/wiki
cd wiki/workshop/docker
```

Build docker image:
```sh
docker build -t singnet .
```

Run docker image with examples:
```sh
docker run -ti singnet
```

After docker image is up you will be in the `singnet` folder which contains all
main SingularityNet git repositories and SingularityNet examples.

Please start with reading `examples/01-snet-cli/README` file and follow instructions.
You can use preinstalled `vim` and `nano` editors to edit example files inside
container.

# Preparations made in image

What is done in the docker image:

* local IPFS instance is deployed and started (see [deploy local IPFS
  instance](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#deploy-local-ipfs-instance)
  and [start local IPFS
  instance](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#start-local-ipfs-instance)
* Ganache instance is started with predefined network number and mnemonic to
  generate predictable accounts numbers and private keys (see [start local
  ethereum
  network](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#start-local-ethereum-network));
* local network id is exported as `$NETWORK_ID` environment variable;
* all contracts are already deployed and their addresses are written to
  `snet-cli` configuration and exported as environment variables:
  `$TOKEN_ADDR`, `$REGISTRY_ADDR`, `$MULTIPARTYESCROW_ADDR`;
* local Ethereum node and IPFS instance are added into snet-cli configuration
  [setup snet-cli
  interface](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#setup-snet-command-line-interface);
* all addresses and private keys generated by Ganache are exported as
  environment variables: `$DEPLOYER_ADDR`, `$DEPLOYER_KEY`, `$CALLER_ADDR`,
  `$CALLER_KEY`, `$PUBLISHER_ADDR`, `$PUBLISHED_KEY`;
* couple of `snet-cli` identities are created: `deployer` and `caller`, which
  are first and second identities generated by ganache-cli on start
  respectively.

In order to see full list of preparations you need to work with local Ethereum
network you need to look at page [build and deploy SingularityNet
locally](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md).
