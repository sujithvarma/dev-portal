# This example shows you how to build and deploy different SingularityNet
# components from source.

# Build and deploy SingularityNet contracts
cd ${SINGNET}/platform-contracts # go to the platform-contracts repository
npm install                      # install dependencies
npm run compile                  # compile contracts
npm run test                     # run contract tests
cat truffle.js                   # add local network to the Truffle configuration
truffle migrate --network local  # deploy contracts to the local network

# Build and install snet-cli
cd ${SINGNET}/snet-cli           # go to the snet-cli repository
./scripts/Blockchain install     # install contract dependencies
pip3 install -e .                # install snet-cli
cat ~/.snet/config               # look at snet-cli configuration

# Build and install SingularityNet daemon
cd ${SINGNET}/snet-daemon                   # go to the daemon repository
./scripts/install                           # install dependencies
./scripts/build linux amd64                 # build daemon
cp ./build/snetd-linux-amd64 ${GOPATH}/bin  # copy binary to the $PATH
