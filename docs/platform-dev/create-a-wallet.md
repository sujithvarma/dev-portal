## Step 1. Metamask
                                                                                                                
[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a browser extension for interacting with Blockchain enabled websites, such as marketplace.
  
Install Metamask now from their website.
                                                                                                                
## Step 2. Create an Identity
                                                                                                                
In the initial startup, Metamask must prompt you to create an identity, which can be used in Blockchain transactions and for storing tokens.
                                                                                                                
To learn more about this, watch the video uploaded on the website or  read about how to us the extensions.
                    
                    
You can also do this using the snet-cli commands


                                                                                                                
## Step 3. What are the different networks?
                                                                                                                
All real value transactions occur in either "Main Ethereum Network" or "Mainnet Network". The other available networks are for testing purposes, and
the tokens on those networks are essentially value-less and are only useful for testing code and software.
                                                                                                                
**Note**: SingularityNet began using  Kovan for testing, but this network may be deprecated soon in favour of Ropsten network.
                                                                                                                
**Important**: The major releases will be on the main network, beginning with the Beta testing in Feb/Mar 2019.

>NOTE: Use the SingularityNET Marketplace in Mainnet Mode whenever you want to integrate an AI service into your software. Use the SingularityNET Marketplace in Ropsten Mode whenever you want to test the platform as a developer. Do not integrate AI services from the Ropsten Network in your software, as their continuous availability is not guaranteed.

## Step 4. Ethereum Faucet (Ropsten Test Network Only)

Ethereum Ropsten coins are free to claim and to test the platform. 

Ropsten Ethereum is needed to cover the Gas costs associated with transactions on the platform. 

Users are required to visit a [Ropsten Faucet](https://faucet.metamask.io/), which is a per-request Ropsten Ethereum distribution hub. 

Users provide  Ropsten Ethereum wallet addresses from the MetaMask to the faucet and distributes an amount of Ropsten Ethereum to the requesting wallet.

## Step 5. AGI Faucet (Ropsten Test Network Only)

To have Ropsten AGI to test the platform, users are required to visit the [AGI Faucet](https://faucet.singularitynet.io/), which is a per-request Ropsten AGI distribution hub. In this case, users provide their Ropsten Ethereum wallet addresses to the Faucet, and a set amount of Ropsten AGI will be transferred to the requesting wallet. In order to receive these tokens, the user must log in via [GitHub](https://github.com/) to access the AGI Ropsten Faucet.
