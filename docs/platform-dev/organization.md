## Organization Metadata

The organization metadata is the description of a SingularityNET service and is, by default, hosted on the SingularityNET IPFS cluster. In order to use a service, the client needs to know the following:
- The Organization metadata
- The Service metadata
There are three ways of providing this metadata to the clients and the daemons:
- Simple JSON file
- IPFS hash that points to the JSON metadata
- Name of service in the Registry 
    The Name of service in the Registry, can be resolved to an IPFS hash, pointing to the metadata, using the Registryâ€™s OrgMetadataURI method. 
    **Note:** Only the Owner of the Organization can modify the metadata.
**Important:** Client must check that the hash of the metadata corresponds to the IPFS hash. Otherwise, If the IPFS client is compromised, the client system can become vulnerable to attack
**Note:** By default, the snet-cli adheres to this verification.

## Description of Fields in metadata file
The following is the list of filed types and their description.
**type** : Describes of this is an Individual or a Company organization contacts : Stores the contacts related to an Organization , you can have multiple contacts contact_type : Describes the contact type , example support etc; email_id : Email associated with this contact phone : Phone number associated with this contact

**groups** : Multiple groups can be associated with an organization, one payment type is associated with every group.
**payment_address** : Address of the Service provider who would receive the payment
**payment_channel_storage_type** : Type of storage to manage payments ( For Example ETCD )

This metadata file can be directly edited before publishing to IPFS, or manipulated by snet-cli through service subcommands that have the metadata-* prefix.
