The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a synthesis of several new and existing innovations. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) is an open-source project.

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network and a network protocol used to store and share data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. Organization details and service details are in IPFS and the associated hash is in a Blockchain.

The components of Inter-Planetary File system are:

* Distributed Hash Tables
* Block Exchanges
* Merkle DAG
* Version Control Systems
* Self-certifying File System


For details on these components, see IPFS Documentation.
