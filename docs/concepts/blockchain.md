title: What is Blockchain Technology?

        
---

Blockchain technology drives cryptocurrency which is a virtual currency secured by cryptography. It is changing the way people, processes and businesses communicate. 
Blockchain is a distributed ledger of an increasing list of records called ‘blocks’ linked using a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The public and decentralized ledger design of Blockchain enables a unified source of data with an audit trail and consistency across the transacting parties without the intermediaries.
With the Blockchain technologies creating a fundamental paradigm shift across the global marketplace, with many far-reaching applications across all industries including loyalty and rewards programs, financial services, consumer packaged goods, healthcare, and government agencies, SingularityNET strives to pursue Artificial Intelligence-enabled opportunities in this technology domain.
