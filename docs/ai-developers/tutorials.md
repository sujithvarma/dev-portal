Our Developer Portal contains documentation about the SingularityNET Platform and Marketplace. 

As a service developer, you can learn how to build and access AI services that are published onto the network. As a client of SingularityNET services, you learn to integrate your software with SingularityNET services that other people have published.

The beta Marketplace is available online at [beta.singularitynet.io](http://beta.singularitynet.io), and allows you to browse a curated set of services available in the registry.

If you're new to SingularityNET, it is recommended that you follow this order to explore the developer portal. For everyone else, it's hopefully a good index to find the information you need.
