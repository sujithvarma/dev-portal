# Collaboration
Once an organization has been set up its possible to add members to it. This provides an easy way to collaborate with other developers and also distribute responsibilities.
Members of an organization can do the following
* Create services
* Manage regions for a service
* Edit / Delete Services

Members **cannot perform any operation at an organization level**. 
Organization level activities such as publishing any changes to the organization etc can only be done by the owner
