## Platform Development
This documentation is intended for developers who want to work on the SingularityNET platform itself.

While we'll happily engage with constructive suggestions for improvement, if you're submitting a substantial change of how things work you'd be best off submitting an issue with your proposal to see if it aligns with the direction we're planning to take SingularityNET in.
