## Troubleshooting

#Common errors returned by the Daemon

### Free call limit has been exceeded.
You have exceeded the number of permitted free calls. So, calls can now be done only using the paid mode alone 


### Rate limiting, too many requests to handle‚Äù
The number of request has increased along with the rate limiting, either retry again later or configure your daemon for [rate limiting](https://github.com/singnet/snet-daemon/tree/master/ratelimit) 

### Unexpected payment type
The supported payment types are free-call / escrow

### If the service is not available on Dapp
If you see the service published on Blockchain , but not on Dapp , then it is very likely that the service is under curation 

If you see a service on Dapp , but is shown as "Not Available", then it is very likely that the end point is temporarily down. You can use the contact-support for any questions

### Lost the private key to your general wallet
You will not be able to link this wallet to an other organization , you can however
continue to use the funds deposited on existing channel or even Top up ( add more funds to your channel)
