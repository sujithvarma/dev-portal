When a user stakes AGI Tokens they have an option to opt-out of the next window. The default behaviour is for the stake amount plus the reward to automatically carry over into the next stake window. 


User can choose to not opt-in at the time of staking itself. In addtion we open a window towards the end of each staking period to opt-out if users want to change their original decision. This enables the user to not carry over their current stake amount and reward into the next stake window and gives them the option to withdraw when the current staking period completes. All these operations can be done through the easy to use AGI <a href="https://staking.singularitynet.io" target="_blank">Staking DApp</a>.
